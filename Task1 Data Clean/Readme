Identify and handle missing values:
Use .isnull() to check for missing values in your dataset. You can then handle them by either filling them with a default value using .fillna() or removing rows/columns with .dropna().

Remove duplicate rows:
The .drop_duplicates() method removes duplicate rows from your dataset, ensuring each row is unique. This is essential to clean up repetitive data that may skew analysis.

Standardize text values:
Standardizing text values (e.g., gender, country names) involves normalizing variations like capitalization and extra spaces. You can use .str.strip() to remove spaces and .str.capitalize() to format text consistently.

Convert date formats to a consistent type (dd-mm-yyyy):
The .to_datetime() function allows you to convert dates to a consistent format. Specify the format using format='%d-%m-%Y' to ensure all dates follow the same structure.

Rename column headers to be clean and uniform:
Column names can be standardized by converting them to lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores. This ensures your DataFrame has clean and consistent column labels.

Check and fix data types:
Use .astype() or .to_numeric() to ensure columns have the correct data type, such as converting age to integers or dates to datetime. This ensures proper analysis and avoids errors during operations.
